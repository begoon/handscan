      <code><h4>25.12.2006</h4></code>
      <p>
      New electronical unit was developed for using in the access control systems based on a "Handscan" system. It might be built in the high power devices of the access control systems. It is monitored by Handshake device via USB & TCP/IP interfaces. It means this unit might be network resourse or simple local device. Moreover,
this unit might be used for driving of high power devices in the modern "smart" systems ( for example "Smart house").

       <code><h4>12.11.2006</code></h4>
       <p>
       The team of the creators informs that the new version of the "Handscan" device was produced. It hasn't the big lens system. So the weight of the new device has been decreased up to 70%. It contains infrared camera, which equiped with small obective-glass. All functions of image corrections are executed by the software only.The photo of the laboratory mock-up is presented below.
