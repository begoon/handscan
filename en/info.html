<h1>
   Handscan system
</h1>

A "Handscan" identification method  was developed for variable
access control systems. 

<p>
This  method envisages compare between an incoming hand image and an archive hand model. An archive hand model is built in accordance with height, width and another  parameters of a hand. A hand model record is made by hand scanning and further information  averaging.
In order to scan, the hand should be placed on the meassure pad. A verification process is executed by a special camera equiped with an infrared backlight. "Handscan" device  received information about the hand dimensions. Scanned hand  is converted to adigital  image by an unique algorithm. After that compare is 
made between incoming hand image and archive hand model. In accordance with compare results system makes its decision.



<h2>Handscan advantages</h2>

At this moment there is one hand biometry identification system in the world only. This is, so called, "Handkey".

<p>
"Handkey" system uses biometrical parameters of a hand by  hand image receive and its further conversion. A hand image is received by built-in camera.
This system has many disadvantages. It takes time for  hand placing within calibrating pins on the measure pad. And thanks to static pins position, there are problems in case of too big or too small hand.
The cameras used in "Handkey" have a low resolution.
At last, "Handkey" is a consol device (it can't  be a network resource) and its user interface is rather limited.

<p>
The new electronic system was developed by us. It uses the same method of biometrical identification. It was named  "Handscan".

<p>

"Handscan" system is unique at this moment. All "Handkey" disadvantages were corrected. So user has a chance to place his hand as he wishes (with variable tilt angle of the fingers).
"Handscan" is standard computer with all standard possibilities. It  has a color monitor with a built-in touchscreen for user-friend   (keyboard free)  interface. "Handscan" is capable of working as a stand alone unit or as a network resource (with function of remote control and adminstration). It is workable on both wired/wireless basis, such as eithernet, Wi-Fi,GPRS, etc. It supports all client/server features, such as database replication, transactions, manual or automatic backup, remote administration.
"Handscan" is capable of power device monitoring, such as lamps, electric engines, electric locks. An approximate network structure is shown below:

<p>

It is capable of additional device using, such as keyboard, additional monitor, printer, cardreader. "Handscan" is capable of hardware upgrade in accordance with the user requirements.
Biometrical identification method is unique.
The Handscan software is unique and workable with "Windows XP" operation system. 



<h2>Application notes</h2>

"Handscan"  might be used in the variable access control systems. For example at school, where it is necessary, firstly, to not allow an access for unauthorized persons,secondly, monitoring of a staff traffic. A basic part of a school contingent are children, they don't have their passports usually and lose very often their special passes.
<p>

<p>
In this case, biometrical identification system would be too acceptable and suitable.In case of trouble (a hand damage or a hand size change) it is possible to register new hand image one more. If it is necessary to show an identification card, a hand biometry might be a "signature" of an identification card holder.
